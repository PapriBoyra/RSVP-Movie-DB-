# RSVP Movies - SQL Analysis Project

## Problem Introduction

RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company that has produced several super-hit movies. While they have primarily catered to the Indian audience, they plan to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.

The company wants to make data-driven decisions for their upcoming project and has provided a dataset containing movie-related information from the past three years. As a data analyst and SQL expert, your task is to analyze the dataset and extract meaningful insights to support their decision-making process.

The analysis is structured into four segments, each providing significant insights based on different table combinations. The business objectives and questions are included in the SQL script file, where solutions must be written and submitted.

About the Assignment

- Where to Get the Data?

You can find detailed information about the dataset and database creation in the following segment.

- Where to Write the Code?

The SQL script file contains all the tasks to be performed. You must write your solutions directly under each question in the provided script file.

- How to Submit the Assignment?

Once you have written the solutions in the SQL script file, submit the same script file in the ‘Submission’ segment.

### Dataset and Database Creation

1. Download the IMDb dataset

2. Review the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and understand the relationships between tables.

3. Inspect each table and understand the features associated with them.

4. Open MySQL Workbench and start writing DDL and DML commands to create and populate the database.

5. If you wish to skip the data loading part, you can directly download the SQL script file with preloaded commands and begin querying.

### Best Practices for Analysis

- Understand the data thoroughly before starting the assignment.

- Read each instruction carefully and perform only the necessary analysis.

- Use meaningful aliases for variable names to enhance readability.

- Optimize SQL queries by using appropriate joins and indexing.

- Cross-check results with given checkpoints to validate correctness.

### Submission Requirements

- SQL Script File: This contains the final SQL queries written under each respective question.

- Executive Summary: A concise report (max 250 words) summarizing key insights and recommendations for RSVP Movies. Save this as a PDF file.

- Final Submission: Place both files in a ZIP folder and submit it in the ‘Submission’ segment.
